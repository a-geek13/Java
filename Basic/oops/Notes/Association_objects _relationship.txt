Association represents the relationship between the objects. 
Here, one object can be associated with one object or many objects. 
There can be four types of association between the objects:

One to One
One to Many
Many to One, and
Many to Many

Let's understand the relationship with real-time examples. 
For example, One country can have one prime minister (one to one), 
and a prime minister can have many ministers (one to many). 
Also, many MP's can have one prime minister (many to one), 
and many ministers can have many departments (many to many).

Association can be undirectional or bidirectional.
