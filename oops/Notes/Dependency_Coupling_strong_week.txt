Coupling refers to the knowledge or information or dependency of another class.

It arises when classes are aware of each other. If a class has the details information of another class, 
there is strong coupling

In Java, we use private, protected, and public modifiers to display the visibility level of a class,
method, and field.

You can use interfaces for the weaker coupling because there is no concrete implementation.
